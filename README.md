#Worry-Free-Morning

#Introduction
This program is for users who likes to wake up their days planned out in front of them. The program allows the user to set an alarm with the alarm sound they like, import Google calendar for display and save their work direction or school direction for display after dismissing the alarm. 

#How to run the program
This program is made with Python and Django. To run the program, start the server by doing "python manage.py runserver" in the "/sites" folder. Then direct to "/local" folder and run "python Top.py" to start the program. The account creation is still under construction. So for now, the user has the direct to "localhost:8000/admin" to manually create the account and log in their information. Once created, the user can simply log on and use the program normally.
